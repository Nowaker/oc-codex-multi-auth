/**
 * Backup path formatting and pre-import backup file writer.
 *
 * Split out of `lib/storage.ts` in RC-2. `createTimestampedBackupPath` is a
 * pure path builder that every backup caller can use without taking a
 * dependency on the import pipeline. `writePreImportBackupFile` is the
 * bounded-time writer used inside `importAccounts` to snapshot the existing
 * accounts file before apply.
 *
 * Every file written here holds live refresh tokens, so the writer is the one
 * place that owns the 0600 mode, the bounded write time, and the temp+rename
 * swap. `writeBackupFileContent` exists so a caller that already has the exact
 * bytes it wants preserved — the pre-write credential snapshotter, which
 * copies the previous file verbatim rather than re-serializing it — does not
 * hand-roll a second writer with weaker guarantees.
