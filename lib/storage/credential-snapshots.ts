/**
 * Pre-write snapshots of the credential stores.
 *
 * The stores are the JSON files holding live refresh tokens: the V3 account
 * store and the flagged-accounts file beside it, which retains quarantined
 * records' refresh tokens so they can be restored later. Anything that
 * replaces either wholesale — a bad merge, a test run that escaped
 * its sandbox, a partial restore — takes the tokens with it, and a backup old
 * enough to predate the last few refreshes restores accounts whose refresh
 * tokens have since been rotated and are therefore dead. This module keeps a
 * bounded ring of recent snapshots so there is always a *live-token* copy to
 * restore from.
 *
 * Two decisions carry the design:
 *
 *   1. The snapshot captures the document already on disk, taken before the
 *      new one replaces it. Snapshotting the incoming document would be
 *      useless for the case this exists for: a clobber would simply be
 *      snapshotted as a clobber. What is worth keeping is the last good state.
 *
 *   2. Significance is a denylist, not an allowlist. Everything counts as a
 *      significant change unless it is explicitly ignored below. A field added
 *      to the schema later therefore cannot silently switch snapshots off; the
 *      worst it can do is cost one extra snapshot, which is recoverable, where
 *      a missing snapshot is not.
