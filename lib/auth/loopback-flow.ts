/**
 * Loopback OAuth session primitive.
 *
 * One typed session shared by the automatic-browser and manual-browser
 * choices: the listener is bound BEFORE any browser is opened, so the browser
 * choice cannot land on a redirect_uri nobody is listening on. Manual mode
 * (`openBrowser=false`) never opens a browser. If the listener cannot bind,
 * the browser is never opened and a typed `unavailable` lifecycle marker is
 * returned; the caller maps that marker to user-facing guidance (label names,
 * fallback instructions) because those belong at the auth-method boundary in
 * index.ts, not inside this primitive.
 *
 * A ready session starts its callback observation IMMEDIATELY, so the
 * listener's existing five-minute deadline runs from session creation rather
 * than from the host's callback. An authorization the host abandons after
 * taking the URL therefore still releases port 1455 instead of pinning it for
 * the lifetime of the process. That observation is normalized so it can never
 * reject: an unobserved rejecting promise would be an unhandled rejection in
 * the window before `waitAndExchange()` awaits it.
 *
 * `waitAndExchange()` remains the lazy token-exchange boundary - the host
 * stores the authorization and calls back separately - and awaits that shared
 * outcome before exchanging the code with the flow's own PKCE verifier and
 * `REDIRECT_URI`. Every terminal path (callback, timeout, external close,
 * opener failure, throwing wait, throwing exchange) runs through one
 * `closeOnce` gate, so `server.close()` happens exactly once. A null callback
 * surfaces as a typed `cancelled` lifecycle result, and a callback arriving
 * after expiry observes that already-settled cancellation.
 *
 * This module holds NO labels, persistence, or OpenCode method shapes. It
 * does not duplicate the URL parser, PKCE generator, callback server, or
 * token exchange - it composes the primitives that already own them.
