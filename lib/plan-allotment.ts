/**
 * How much Codex capacity one ChatGPT plan carries relative to another.
 *
 * A pool of accounts on different plans has no single "percent used": one
 * Pro seat spent to 50% has given up far more capacity than a Business
 * Standard seat spent to 50%, so averaging the two percentages unweighted
 * reports a pool that does not exist. Every plan here therefore carries a
 * {@link PlanAllotment.weight} - its allotment relative to a 1x seat - and the
 * pool total is the weighted mean.
 *
 * The weights are OpenAI's own published per-seat ratios, taken from the
 * plan's monthly price against the 1x Plus/Business Standard seat: Pro is
 * $200 against $20, and is marketed as 20x. They describe the *subscription*,
 * not a measured token allowance, which is the only ratio OpenAI states and
 * the same one the seat is sold on.
 *
 * `plan_type` is what the `/wham/usage` endpoint and the `chatgpt_plan_type`
 * access-token claim report. Two of its slugs are not derivable from their
 * text - `team` is the slug still emitted for what OpenAI now calls Business,
 * and `self_serve_business_prolite` is the premium Business seat rather than
 * the personal Pro Lite tier that shares the `prolite` token - so both are
 * matched explicitly below.
 *
 * This module is deliberately a leaf (no imports). The prompt status line
 * depends on it, and naming a plan is a separate concern that already has an
 * owner in `lib/auth/plan-tier.ts`; pulling that in here would drag JWT
 * decoding into the TUI's render path for a number that needs none of it.
