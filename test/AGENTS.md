# TEST KNOWLEDGE BASE

## OVERVIEW

Vitest suites covering the OAuth flow, request transforms, response handling,
model catalog, rotation logic, storage, tools/CLI, TUI, and recovery.

The suite is large and evolves frequently. Use the current test tree and local
commands as the source of truth instead of hard-coded totals or committed file
lists. As of this writing the suite is 113 test files: 95 top-level plus
`chaos/` (9), `property/` (6), and `contracts/` (3).

```bash
find test -name '*.test.ts' | sort     # current inventory
npm test -- <substring>                # target a subset
```

## STRUCTURE

```text
test/
├── AGENTS.md                 # this file
├── README.md                 # human-facing suite guide
├── *.test.ts                 # unit + integration suites, named after the module under test
├── chaos/                    # fault injection and adverse-condition stress
├── contracts/                # upstream wire-shape contracts (chat, SSE, token)
└── property/                 # fast-check property tests + shared helpers
```

Naming convention: a suite is named after what it covers, so
`lib/storage/keychain.ts` → `storage-keychain.test.ts`, and
`lib/tools/codex-pool.ts` → `tools-codex-pool.test.ts`. Follow this when adding
coverage.

| Circuit breaker | `circuit-breaker*.test.ts` | failure isolation and wiring |
| Storage | `storage*.test.ts`, `paths.test.ts`, `credential-clobber.test.ts` | V3 format, migration, per-project paths, keychain |
| Model pools | `model-pool-config.test.ts`, `tools-codex-pool.test.ts` | `modelAccountPools` resolution and mutation |
| Tools + registry | `index.test.ts`, `tools-codex-*.test.ts` | per-tool behavior and registry wiring |
| Standalone CLI | `standalone-cli.test.ts`, `cli.test.ts`, `install-oc-codex-multi-auth.test.ts` | bin commands and installer |
| TUI quota | `tui-*.test.ts` | prompt status, shared cache, refresh events |
| UI helpers | `ui-*.test.ts`, `account-display.test.ts`, `beginner-ui.test.ts` | formatting, theme, no-color, checklists |
| Recovery | `recovery*.test.ts` | session recovery and auto-resume |
| Docs parity | `doc-parity.test.ts` | docs/config/tool-registry/link/version drift |
| Property tests | `property/` | fast-check randomized invariants |
| Contracts | `contracts/` | upstream wire shapes |
| Chaos | `chaos/` | fault injection and stress |

## CONVENTIONS

- Vitest globals are enabled (`describe`, `it`, `expect`).
- Coverage thresholds are enforced by `vitest.config.ts`; statements/functions/lines
  keep an 80% global floor, while branch and legacy `index.ts` floors are
  calibrated to the current broad coverage baseline.
- Lint rules are relaxed for tests (see `eslint.config.js`).
- Property tests use fast-check for randomized testing.

## ANTI-PATTERNS

- Avoid hardcoding ports other than 1455 for OAuth server tests.
- Do not rely on `dist/` in tests; import from source.
- Do not skip tests without justification.
- Do not assert on wall-clock timing; use fake timers or injected clocks.
- Do not commit an exhaustive test-file list into docs — it goes stale. Point at
  `find test -name '*.test.ts'` instead.
- When changing a documented contract (tool count, config key, storage path,
  catalog size), update `doc-parity.test.ts` and the affected docs in the same
  change.
